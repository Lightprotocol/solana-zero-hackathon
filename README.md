# ZK Compression Summer 

**ZK Compression Summer** is a dedicated side track for the [Solana Radar Hackathon](https://www.colosseum.org/radar).

* Hackathon dates: September 2nd through October 8.
* Type: Online and global
* More details: [Side track website](https://www.zkcompression.com/introduction/event).
* Project registration form: Register [here](https://forms.gle/2H8m4Uzv4syY8U3X8).


### Introduction

ZK Compression reduces the cost of accounts and tokens on Solana by up to 1000x. Combining ZK Compression with Solana's core features gives hackers an open design space to create entirely new applications that could bring in the next wave of crypto users.

As long as you have an internet connection, you can join the first global hackathon side track dedicated to ZK Compression! The only requirement is that teams must incorporate ZK Compression into their project in some way. Take a look at our [list of ideas](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/zk-compression-summer-hackathon/blob/main/ideas.md) for inspiration.


### Get Started Building

### Judging
The Radar Hackathon's [submission rules](https://www.colosseum.org/_app/immutable/assets/Solana%20Radar%20Hackathon%20Official%20Rules%202024.8c044e21.pdf) apply. To be eligible for the side track, participants must register in the project registration form shared above and submit their project to the Radar Hackathon before 2nd October. Once all submissions are collected, we will distribute a list to the side-track judges for evaluation.

Teams and individuals are evaluated on the following criteria:

* Functionality
* Potential impact
* Novelty
* Design
* Extensibility

After the judges complete individual evaluations, they will discuss and choose the winners based on the project's weighted scores.

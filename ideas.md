# Hackathon Ideas 

We have compiled a list of interesting ideas to explore during the Solana Zero Hackathon. We encourage you to pursue any idea that interests you. The list below can serve as inspiration.


## Explorers/Visualizers

-   Blockchain explorers and visualizers for Solana transactions that involve ZK Compression and Compressed tokens.

-   Storage cost savings UI: a tool that visualizes the rent savings with ZK Compression vs. regular Solana accounts based on account size or tokens in the user's wallet.

## Tooling / Developer Experience

-   Compressed Token Minter: A simple interface for developers to launch their own Compressed Token.

-   Bidirectional SPL Token 'Compressor': A simple interface to compress and decompress your SPL tokens and reclaim your token rent.

-   Visualizers: Portfolio charts for Compressed Tokens.

-   Wallet UI: A web wallet or browser extension for Compressed Tokens.

-   Spam filter API: A tool that lets users view their assets based on how many lamports are attached to each asset.

-   Compressed Name Service

-   A program that can accept any compressed asset transfer to a compressed name service.

-   Ports of the existing ZK Compression SDKs in other languages.

-   Fraud proofs SDK: a toolkit for implementing fraud proofs on top of ZK Compression.

-   zk-Oracles: an oracle that proves TLS signatures inside a SNARK and uses compressed PDAs to store data.

## DeFi

-   Compressed Token Swap: A tool to easily trade compressed tokens, e.g., by decompressing, swapping, and compressing atomically.

-   Build-your-own Liquidity Mining platform using compressed tokens or compressed PDAs.

-   Payments: A payments application for compressed token transfers on Solana.
  
-   Trust-minimized cross-chain token bridge or swap using compression to sync Merkle roots.

-   Off-chain matching engine for trades that settle verifiably on-chain, using ZK Compression for state merklelization.

## Gaming/Social

-   On-chain text-based games using compressed PDAs to store state.

-   An NFT program using compressed accounts.

-   A bidirectional NFT compressor compatible with existing layouts to reclaim rent.

-   Compressed Wager: Prediction markets on tokenized Twitter posts.

-   Compressed Blinks: a Blink that leverages compressed tokens or compressed accounts.

-   Text-based on-chain games to generate unique NFTs én masse using ZK Compression.

-   NFT generator: Allow creators to easily issue NFTs én masse to their community using ZK Compression.

-   On-chain PvP game with hidden information using zkSNARKs.
